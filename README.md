# Object detection in the context of permaculture

Permaculture is a concept of cyclic, symbotic and permanent land use for growing vegetables and fruits.
In contrast to conventional agriculture, plants are kept permanently and symbiotic effects between neighboured plants
(e.g. fruit trees, berry shrubs, etc.)
are used to overcome problems of pest infestation and weeds. While this enables the efficient production
of organic food, it is hardly possible to manage such land using conventional land machines. Permaculture requires
a lot of manual labor.

To further support the labor - or in the long term replace it - we propose image classification and object detection
usage to visually detect fruits and plants using a conventional camera. This might be the base for future robotics
usage in permacultural context.

## Rationales of this repository

This repository should provide some guidance on how to get grip on the topic of deep learning 
and object detection using Tensorflow. It provides links to helpful online resources, sample codes and further ideas
on how to use Tensorflow Object Detection API.

The major objective of permaculture is to inhabit and use earth in a sustainable fashion. Reflecting on this,
we feel that we should publish the understanding we gained during the building of our prototype. This way
we can contribute to the interested community and help build a sustaining knowledge base.

This repository is the result of implementing a prototypical Tomato detection system that runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 and
AWS cloud.

## About us

We are a small team of four students that created this project during a project semester. The seminar context was
about technological innovation in the food producing sector from the perspective ot sustainable development. We are
an interdisciplinary team of engineers, computer scientists, environmental scientists and business administrators.
